      <h2 class="bodyHeading">Why I chose Checkers?</h2>

      <p>When thinking of games to do, I remembered checkers along with many more. The reason checkers stood out to me was because I had forgotten the rules. I have alot of childhood memories playing checkers at school with friends and being among the better of my peers which makes checker related memories fond ones. 
        Realizing such made me sad at first, but inspired me to use this oportunity to relearn the rules. Coming into this assignment I was very stressed and frustrated, but after spending the whole day on my laptop doing this assignment, I became fond of it. I wish I had started earlier and had more time to improve rather than my focus being on fulfilling the requirements mostly. 
      </p>
